# Higher_Lower_Game
A representation of the popular Higher-Lower guessing game. Here, the Instagram followers count of celebrities and famous pages were taken as the game data.  

Initially, the user is asked to pick one out of two options (randomly selected). If correct the user score increases with 1 and the correctly guessed option becomes the first option of the next repetition of the cycle. Another celebrity/famous page is chosen from the list and is compared with this option and so on. The game ends when the user guesses a wrong option.
